## WhatsApp Bot!

This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube Series showing how to create a custom REST API in Golang. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

- Create a custom web server with Golang using HTTPRouter
- Create a simple REST API that serves Youtube stats (as an example use case)
- Automatically containerize and push a Docker container to Docker hub using Github Actions
- Create a Kubernetes Helm chart for deploying your API to Kubernetes
- Push your Helm chart to a Helm Chart repo using Github Actions and Github Pages (coming soon)
- How to write a good README (you are reading it now!)
